    Good morning, class.
Good morning to you!
How are you?
I’m fi ne, thank you.
What is it? It’s an eraser.
What is it? It’s a ruler.
What is it? It’s a pencil.
What is it? It’s a crayon
Now pick up your pen
And open your book.
Say the words 
And write with me. 
Let’s start now. 1, 2, 3!
CHORUS.
